Testing

#Goal
The goal of this project is to create a mail dispatch service that polls the (Check Your Rep) [http://www.checkyourrep.org] grapqhl endpoint once a day for bills that interest a user. The service then email updates on those bills if they fit the user's criteria.
The application will rely on Mailgun for email services and Firebase for access to the app's users.

## 11/15
Today I am going to integrate the Mailgun api into the app, and successfully send myself an email.
